# Welcome

Welcome to [gunmack.dev](https://www.gunmack.dev/)!</br>
This is a static React website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework

## Purpose

This is meant to serve as my personal website I use to link my other projects  
and social media accounts. I am currenty in the process of designing a [new
personal website](https://github.com/gunmack/276_website) as part of a submission for one of my courses.  

## Deployment

This site is currently deployed through [Amazon Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) under the domain name `gunmack.dev`


<!-- *Ignore the following -->

<!-- ## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
